            <ul>
                <li> cups (300 grams) carrots, peeled</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cup (325 grams) sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup (250 mililiters) vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose (256 grams) flour, sifted</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>A pinch of salt</li>

            <h6>Method</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven at 350°F/180°C</li>
                <li>Butter the springform pan and dust flour through it or spray a thin layer of cooking spray on it</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, add the baking powder to the flour and mix the ingredients delicately. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Crack the eggs one by one into a small bowl, transferring each one of them to the blender before cracking the next egg. This way, one spoilt egg won’t ruin your beautiful batter</li>
                <li>Add the oil, salt, sugar, and peeled carrots cut in chunks to the blender and blend until it’s homogeneous</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into the large bowl with flour and mix gently until all flour has incorporated</li>
                <li>Now, pour the batter into the springform pan and bake it for approximately 50 minutes</li>
                <li>Before removing your carrot cake from the oven, stick the cake tester or a toothpick into the middle of the cake</li>
                <li>If it comes out dry, your cake is done. If not, give it a few more minutes and try again</li>
                <li>Once you’re done, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool down for 10-15 minutes before removing the springform pan</li>  
            </ol>
